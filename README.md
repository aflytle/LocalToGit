A Compendium of our Code:

1. All3.C is all 3 combinatoric functions for particle correlation approximation, appropriately named in reference to 
the three functions.

2. FallinFac1.C is the is falling factorial function by itself.

3. Function2.C and Function3.C are the combinatoric approximations as edited through time, one following the other.

4. ToyMonteCarlo.C is our first Monte Carlo machine, an approximation method for statistical distribution we will use in the
project.

5. aidan.tex is a Beamer powerpoint type in latex, that compares the .png graphic outputs of the All3.C code.

6. compie.bash is the compile code for our edits on simple_particle.C, as it requires pathway specifications in the bash
file to find Pythia, ROOT, and other libraries.

7. nchoosekvar1var2.C is our first few attempts and edits on the combinatoric approximation, with the only caveat to date
being the integer overflow on the function (in repair right now, update coming soon).

8. simple_particle.C uses Pythia and ROOT to output a simulated particle collision, and histograms of its angular distibution,
basic particle count, and some other useful statistics.
