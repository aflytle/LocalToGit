A Compendium of our *current* Code:

1. **All3.C** is all 3 combinatoric functions for particle correlation approximation, appropriately named in reference to 
the three functions.

2. **ToyMonteCarlo.C** is our first Monte Carlo machine, an approximation method for statistical distribution we will use in the project.

3. **aidan.tex** is a Beamer powerpoint type in latex, that compares the .png graphic outputs of the All3.C code.

4. **compile.bash** is the compile code for our edits on simple_particle.C, as it requires pathway specifications in the bash
file to find Pythia, ROOT, and other libraries.

5. **simple_particle.C** uses Pythia and ROOT to output a simulated particle collision, and histograms of its angular distibution, basic particle count, and some other useful statistics.


~~useless b.s.~~ Out of Date (Rest in Pieces):

1.  **FallinFac1.C** is the is falling factorial function by itself.

2. **Function2.C** and Function3.C are the combinatoric approximations as edited through time, one following the other.

3.  **nchoosekvar1var2.C** is our first few attempts and edits on the combinatoric approximation, with the only caveat to date
being the integer overflow on the function (in repair right now, update coming soon).
